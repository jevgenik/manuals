--- ROS2 commands ---
  --- TF2 commands ---
  Generate pdf file with TF transform tree
  `ros2 run tf2_tools view_frames.py`

  `tf_echo` reports the transform between any two frames broadcast over ROS
  `ros2 run tf2_ros tf2_echo <parent frame> <child frame>`

  --- ROS2 topic commands ---
  `ros2 topic echo /wheel/odometry`
  `ros2 topic echo /my_topic --no-arr` --no-addr - don't print array fields of messages

  Retrieve information about a topic
  `ros2 topic info /tf --verbose`

  Name remapping
  `ros2 run rplidar_ros rplidar_node --ros-args -r __ns:=scanner2`
  `-r __ns:=scanner2` this changes the namespace of the node rplidar_node to 'scanner2' (/scanner/rplidar_node) 
  `-r __node:=<new node name>` this renames the node to 'new_node_name'.
  Namespace allows you to run multiple instances of the same node with separate parameter spaces.

  --- ROS2 params ---
  To see the parameters belonging to your nodes
  `ros2 param list`

  To display the type and current value of a parameter
  `ros2 param get <node_name> <parameter_name>`

  This command will set the value of a particular parameter on a particular node. 
  `ros2 param set <node_name> <parameter_name> <parameter_value>`
  `ros2 param set /my_node my_string off`

  To save your current configuration of node’s parameters, enter the command:
  `ros2 param dump <node_name>`

  --- ROS2 control commands ---
  `ros2 control list_controllers` - list loaded controllers, their type and status
  `ros2 control list_hardware_components` - list available hardware components
  `ros2 control list_hardware_interfaces` - list available command and state interfaces

  --- Package commands ---
  Get the installation location of package
  `ros2 pkg prefix <package name>`

  --- RQT commands ---
  RQT is a Qt-based framework for GUI development for ROS. 
  Qt is a cross-platform application framework that is widely used for developing application software with a 
  graphical user interface (GUI)
  rqt is a meta package that depends on all available e.g rqt_graph, rqt_image_view, etc
  `ros2 run rqt_graph rqt_graph` - show graph of nodes and topics (rqt_graph is a part of rqt_graph package)
                                   rqt_graph is a dynamic GUI plugin for visualizing the ROS computation graph.
                                   (dynamic plugin is a plugin that can be loaded and unloaded at runtime)
  `ros2 run rqt_image_view rqt_image_view` - show image from camera (rqt_image_view is a part of rqt_image_view package)
