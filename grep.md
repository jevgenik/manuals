Grep is a command-line utility for searching plain-text data sets for lines that match a regular expression. 
Its name comes from the ed command g/re/p (globally search a regular expression and print), which has the same effect: 
doing a global search with the regular expression and printing all matching lines.

$ - end of line (e.g. a$ - lines that end with a)
^ - start of line (e.g. ^a - lines that start with a)
. - any character (e.g. a.b - lines that contain a, then any character, then b)
