Rules for AI
------------

**Project rules** offers a powerful and flexible system with path specific configurations.
Project rules are stored in the .cursor/rules directory and provide granular control over AI behavior in different parts of your project.


**Global Rules** are stored in the .cursor/rules/global.yaml file and apply to all projects.
